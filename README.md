# **Malaria Spread Prediction Using Climate and Socioeconomic Factors**

## **Project Overview**  
This project explores how climate factors influence the exponential spread of malaria across different regions. Additionally, it investigates whether socioeconomic factors (health care, education, and agricultural involvement) contribute to malaria transmission rates. The goal is to understand the underlying patterns that drive malaria spread and leverage models to predict outbreaks.  

## **Research Questions**  
- How do climate factors influence the exponential spread of malaria across different regions?  
- Do socioeconomic factors (health care, education, and agricultural involvement) impact the spread of malaria across different regions?  

## **Hypothesis**  
We hypothesize that malaria spread is strongly correlated with regions experiencing high humidity and temperature, as these conditions create an ideal breeding environment for mosquitoes. With an increase in mosquito populations, malaria transmission is expected to rise exponentially. Additionally, socioeconomic factors such as low income, lower education levels, and occupations involving outdoor exposure may significantly contribute to higher malaria infection rates.  

## **Methodology**  

### **1. Data Collection**  
- Obtained datasets containing climate data and malaria case reports from multiple regions.  
- Collected socioeconomic data (health care statistics, education statistics, and occupational demographics).  

### **2. Data Preprocessing**  
- Cleaned the datasets to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.  
- Merged relevant data sources to create a comprehensive dataset.  

### **3. Data Analysis & Visualization**  
- Created visualizations to identify relationships between climate conditions, socioeconomic factors, and malaria spread.  
- Examined trends and correlations using graphs and statistical methods.  

## **Findings and Insights**  
- Preliminary analysis suggests a strong correlation between high humidity, temperature, and malaria case increases.  
- Certain occupations, particularly those involving outdoor exposure, appear to increase malaria risk.
